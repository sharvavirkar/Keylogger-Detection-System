The keylogger presented is a sophisticated and multi-functional security tool designed with both
offensive and defensive capabilities. Unlike traditional keyloggers that simply record keystrokes, this
implementation incorporates advanced features such as behavioral biometrics, anomaly detection
using machine learning (Isolation Forest with PCA), and blockchain technology for secure audit
logging. It employs strong encryption (Fernet) to protect logged data and includes comprehensive
system monitoring to detect suspicious activities, such as memory injections, network anomalies,
and malicious processes. The tool also supports red team operations with features like keystroke
injection, honeypot deployment, and simulated attack payloads, while its blue team functionalities
include file integrity checks, antivirus detection, and threat intelligence integration. By combining
keystroke dynamics analysis with risk scoring and multi-factor authentication, it provides a robust
mechanism for user verification. Overall, this keylogger demonstrates how keylogging technology
can be enhanced with modern security practices, making it not just a surveillance tool but a
comprehensive security solution for both penetration testing and defensive monitoring. However,
its dual-use nature means it must be used responsibly and ethically to avoid misuse.
